# Work log

Append-only. Newest entries go at the bottom, above the template. Do not edit past entries except to fix a factual error (note the fix).

## 2026-10-06

- Reviewed the design documents (Khata direction, screens k1 to k29, key patterns, privacy and sync, component inventory).
- Stack decision: switched from Kotlin and Compose to React Native with TypeScript (Expo, react-native-paper, react-navigation, zustand, SQLCipher SQLite). See decisions.md 1 and 2.
- Wrote CLAUDE.md, docs/README.md, docs/product.md, docs/design-system.md and docs/screens.md.
- Restructured the repo into `frontend/`, `backend/`, `docs/` and `.github/`.
- Wrote docs/architecture.md, backend.md, testing.md, decisions.md, worklog.md and progress.md (planned design, marked where specifics may change).
- Started parallel work: frontend foundation (theme, navigation, shared components), backend sync service with Docker, and docs.
